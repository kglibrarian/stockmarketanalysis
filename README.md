# stockmarketanalysis

The Stock Market Analysis repository uses VBA scripting and Microsotft Excel to analyze real stock market data. 

## Background

We used VBA scripts to loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year. We 
display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume. We also looped through the stock data to show:
* the yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was
* the percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed
* and conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
